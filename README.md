# UV_and_PL
## This repository contains python codes for analyzing UV and PL spectra, both involving Franck-Condon Analysis. 


In the UV code, it plots the UV absorption spectra and simulate the low-energy part which is believed to attribute to the aggregates of P3HT. The ratio of extinction coefficients of aggregate and non-aggregate phase could be calculated from the differences of the spectra when the temperature changes. Thus, the percent of aggregates in the solid-state P3HT films could be calculated by integrating FC analysis and extinction coefficients.
